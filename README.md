# Kt2ts
A [Gradle Plugin](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/custom_plugins.html) which converts Kotlin data models into Typescript. It uses Alicia Boya GarcÃ­a's [TypeScript definition generator](https://github.com/ntrrgc/ts-generator) for that.

> Plugin is built with TDD approach demonstrated by Stefan May's in his [Gloc](https://github.com/StefMa/Gloc) Gradle Plugin.

## How to use
One is able to use/apply the plugin with ```build.gradle.kts```:
```kotlin
plugins {
  id("kotlin2ts.kt2ts") version "1.0.0"
}

kt2ts {
  packs = arrayOf("org.fidget.models")
}
```

or ```build.gradle```:
```groovy
plugins {
  id("kotlin2ts.kt2ts").version("1.0.0")
}

kt2ts {
  packs = ["org.fidget.models"]
}
```

## Extension configuration
The extension provides only one property:
* packs - a array of packages where data models to be converted into TypeScript are situated

## Task
